To run the streamlit app on your local machine, install the dependencies and run `streamlit run stream_app.py` in the virtual environment you have set up.


You need to have set up your Databricks Workspace, Databricks Access Token and generate an API endpoint. You need to configure those details in the `.env` file which will be read by the streamlit app.
